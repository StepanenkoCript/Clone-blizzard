# Clone-blizzard

![](blizzard.gif)

Hey community!

Just made this blizzard.com clone to improve my html / css skills.

I know it is not responsive, and also not "mobile first" made, but it was my second website clone, and i was pretty new to this coding thing :P
I tried to make it as similar as possible both in colors, as in the animations of the buttons and photos, and i can guarantee that this clone exercise helped me to fix a lot of concepts used in CSS, like flexbox, item positioning and centering, as well as transition effects, etc. 

**** IMPORTANT:*******

1 - Since it was one of my first exercises, it is not responsive and not mobile first :( im sorry

2 - To visualize correctly this webpage, you MUST use a desktop using 1920x1080 resolution. Im sorry for this requirement, but again: that was my second clone and the point here was improve css and html skills
